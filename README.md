Problem 1:
  I have created a class named "Car" with attributes such as ID, Make, Model, Year of Manufacture, Color, Price, and Registration Number.
  I have also created an array of Car objects to store car information.
  I've implemented three functionalities to save data to different files:
                                                        a) A list of cars of a given brand.
                                                        b) A list of cars of a given model that have been in use for more than "n" years.
                                                        c) A list of cars of a given year of manufacture, the price of which is higher than the specified one.
